# Project_2

## Sources

1. Starter Code provided in the asssignments file
2. Stack Overflow was a great help in reminding me of different ways to create dataframes from lists and dictionaries
3. [Regex Pal](https://www.regexpal.com/)

## Group Contributions

We decided as a team, based on the project description, to do the work all together. The Category and Subcategory dataframes were created together. Most of the rest of the project was done individually with the rest of the group being able to help eachother in difficult spots. Every group member that contributed has their very own branch in the repository to push the code they created. The Main branch is used as the final submission for the entire group, buit each individuals contributions can be found in those branches.

## Conclusions
1. This project was a great way of testing our knowledge from the pst few weeks of class. 
  - The ability to split one item into two
  - creating/merging dataframes
  - renaming/dropping/adding dataframe columns
  - changing types of a column
  - list comprehension
  - dictionaries
  - regex
  - ERDs
  - SQL Databases (creating tables, importing csvs)

## Areas for Improvement

1. With the help of Stack Overflow and Regex Pal, I managed to figure out the regex expressions. However with more practice and imporvement I can become more accurate and independant with the expressions.
2. Paying more attention to data types in QuickDBD to be able to use in PGAdmin. I had to go through and change every 'string' to 'varchar'
